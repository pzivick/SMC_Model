Notes/Description: This is a collection of functions
that are needed in order to run the Make_predictions
Jupyter notebook. These functions are adopted from earlier
versions written for the Zivick+2021 analysis, in particular
updating to use column names in manipulations rather than
explicitly stated indice variables.
